## 🎯 Today’s Project Spotlight: Simple Calculator 🧠

A basic yet powerful script that performs math operations based on user input.

📥 Takes two numbers from the user  
➕ Prompts for an operator (+, -, *, /)  
📤 Displays the calculated result  
🧠 Uses type conversion, input handling, and string formatting
